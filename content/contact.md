The idea for the game was born during the gender-based violence hackathon in Cape Town 2019. Taskeen, Leandri, Kimberly (South Africa) and Daria (Germany) formed the all-female Team Nerdbirds and took second place. 

Encouraged by the positive feedback, the team decided to continue and further develop the idea. Soon after Rimi and Tammy from Canada joined to support the team.

We'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions on how we could improve!
